# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

In this project, I have reviewed everything about Python:

* Import
* Exceptions
* Class
* Private attribute
* Getter/Setter
* Class method
* Static method
* Inheritance
* Unittest
* Read/Write file

Not only that, but also I had to learn new things such us:
* args and kwargs
* Serialization/Deserialization
* JSON (encoder and decoder)
